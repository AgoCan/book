The Best Ever Fascinating Experience for Me in Old-Boy!

Dating back to March 2017, I successfully obtained my master degree in Finance in the University of Liverpool in UK. After that, I strongly made up my mind to pursue my PhD degree in the University of Nottingham, UK campus. As finance industry is the one of the most amazing competitive, of course, highly-demanding domains nowadays, handling the most beautiful and simple programming language --- Python, is absolutely the most urgent thing in my to-do list.

Thus, I began to search all kinds of python live courses on line. Interestingly, a famous training institution called Old-Boy along with a renowned and popular lecturer name --- Alex came up on the screen, which seems to be exactly what I am looking for. So far, the most unforgettable story in my whole life in Old-Boy began.

During 4-month intensive, professional and concentrated training in Old-Boy. I met up with so many fantastic Python lecturers---Alex, Haifeng Lin, Hao Yuan and so on. They are so dedicated to Python training, which is a lifetime career they would pursue; they are so responsible for each student, no matter the student has python foundation or not; they are lecturing us in an extremely humorous way that you ever couldn’t imagine.


I made lots of new friends there, and they are all gold people---My fellow classmates, who will also be my forever friends in the rest of my life. They help me a lot with Python programming, which touches me many times! Here, I would like to give all of them thumb to express my sincere thanks, especially for Yongchang Guo, Shaowei Fang, Dakun Yuan and Tao Chen!

I would like to say, from the bottom of my heart, Old-Boy is the most supreme Python training institution in China, which facilitates students who are keen on Python! Old-Boy is No.1 highly recommended training institution in my heart! I would say, this Python learning journey is one of the most amazing memory for me! Old-Boy, thank you!
